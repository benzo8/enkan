    Calculates and assigns weights to all nodes in the tree based on the current mode and slope settings.

    This function determines the starting nodes at the lowest rung (level) of the tree, applies the appropriate
    mode and slope (as resolved from the defaults), fills in missing proportions for these nodes, and then
    recursively processes each node to assign weights throughout the tree.

    The weights are apportioned according to the calculated proportions and any weight modifiers present.
    This ensures that the final weights reflect the desired balancing or weighting strategy for the slideshow.
